Title: Internship

Date: Dec. 2019

Short Description:
Cai did an internship in Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), New Mexico, from 06/2019 to 12/2019. He worked on a project of "developing a novel interpretable machine learning model" with LANL scientist Dr. Hassan Hijazi. 

While classical machine learning algorithms heavily rely on unconstrained optimization techinieques, this internship project mainly focuses on developing a constrained-based approach, called Hypersphere Classifier, to help guide and accelerate machine learning process. Our preliminary results demonstrate, in the case of 2-D object shape recognition, i.e., handwritten digit classification, this new classfifier can reach 92.0% accuracy while visualizing whole learning process.
