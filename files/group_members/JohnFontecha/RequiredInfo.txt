come up with some posts (pic + title + descriptions): Pending, I do not have news to share, I believe. 
list of research areas: (I am not sure of these, but I can discuss with Dr. Walteros) Energy systems, Sustainable systems, Transportation and logistics systems
Current Projects: Data-driven optimization models for the distribution of incentives to maximize behavior/product adoption: a) Promoting the installation of green infrastructure in private land, b) Reach maximization for social loteries.
